## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


Landing Page by Sage Allott 2020
Includes JS, HTML and CSS files. HTML and CSS files have been updated to make the page unique.

Interactivity added using JavaScript. File dynamically builds page navigation based on HTML sections, checks which section is currently being viewed, adds an active class to the section being viewed, and styles the navigation accordingly.

Page also features a "back to top" button that uses simple HTML to jump back to the top of the page.

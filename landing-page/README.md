# Landing Page Project

Landing Page by Sage Allott 2020
Includes JS, HTML and CSS files. HTML and CSS starter files have been updated to make the page unique.

Interactivity added using JavaScript. File dynamically builds page navigation based on HTML sections, checks which section is currently being viewed, adds an active class to the section being viewed, and styles the navigation accordingly.

Page also features a "back to top" button that uses simple HTML to jump back to the top of the page.
